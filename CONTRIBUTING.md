# Contributing to React Cutout

I love your input! I want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:
- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features (preferably with a suggestion of how to realize them)

## I Develop with Github
I use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/Jan-MK/react-cutout/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](...); it's that easy!
